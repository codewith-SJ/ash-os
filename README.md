Ash OS is an Arch Linux based Linux distribution aimed towards lower-end systems. It aims to provide a better battery life and performance on such systems compared to other leading distributions. 

The project also aims to provide a seamless experience for systems to run Android and Windows applications out of the box without requiring additional configuration.
